# -Perpendicular-Trisectors-and-Base-Trisectors-in-Triangles-and-Quadrilaterals

While classical triangle centers—centroid, orthocenter, incenter, and circumcenter—are well-studied through bisections, this paper dives into the lesser-known world of trisectors, particularly base and perpendicular trisectors. Inspired by Morley’s Theorem, we explore new theorems that reveal elegant geometric patterns when trisecting triangle bases and perpendiculars.

Our research proposes three novel theorems:

Base Trisectors Theorem – Intersections form a triangle similar to the original, from both first and second neighbor constructions.

Perpendicular Trisectors Theorem – Similar triangles emerge again, with all having the same circumcenter as the original triangle.

Quadrilateral n-section Theorem – Extends trisection ideas to quadrilaterals and beyond, showing that trisectors can generalize classic midpoint properties.

Using a combination of rigorous geometric proofs and dynamic GeoGebra visualizations, this paper proposes a shift from classical bisection to a trisection-based framework for geometric exploration, with potential applications in Olympiad geometry and mathematical modeling.
